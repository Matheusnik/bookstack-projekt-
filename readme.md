## üìö Defini√ß√£o de Projeto

BookStack √© uma plataforma de documenta√ß√£o opinativa que oferece uma experi√™ncia agrad√°vel, simples e pronta para uso. Os novos usu√°rios de uma inst√¢ncia devem achar a experi√™ncia intuitiva e apenas habilidades b√°sicas de processamento de texto devem ser necess√°rias para se envolver na cria√ß√£o de conte√∫do no BookStack.
A plataforma deve fornecer recursos avan√ßados de energia para aqueles que os desejam, mas n√£o devem interferir na experi√™ncia simples do usu√°rio.

BookStack n√£o foi projetado como uma plataforma extens√≠vel para ser usada para prop√≥sitos diferentes da afirma√ß√£o acima.

No que diz respeito √† filosofia de desenvolvimento, BookStack tem uma abordagem descontra√≠da, aberta e positiva. No final das contas, este √© um software livre desenvolvido e mantido por pessoas que doam seu pr√≥prio tempo livre.

Voc√™ pode ler mais sobre o projeto e suas origens em [our FAQ here](https://www.bookstackapp.com/about/project-faq/).


## üõ†Ô∏è Desenvolvimento e Teste

Consulte os [documentos de desenvolvimento](dev/docs/development.md) para obter detalhes completos sobre o trabalho no c√≥digo-fonte do BookStack.

Se voc√™ deseja apenas personalizar ou estender sua pr√≥pria inst√¢ncia do BookStack, d√™ uma olhada em [p√°gina de documenta√ß√£o do Hacking BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/hacking-
bookstack/) para obter detalhes sobre v√°rias op√ß√µes para conseguir isso sem alterar o c√≥digo-fonte do BookStack.

Detalhes sobre o esquema de versionamento do BookStack e o processo geral de lan√ßamento [podem ser encontrados aqui](dev/docs/release-process.md).

## üåé Translations

Translations for text within BookStack is managed through the [BookStack project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/bookstack). Some strings have colon-prefixed variables such as `:userName`. Leave these values as they are as they will be replaced at run-time.

Please use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/bookstack) to contribute translations instead of opening a pull request. The translations within the working codebase can be out-of-date, and merging via code can cause conflicts & sync issues. If for some reason you can't use Crowdin feel free to open an issue to discuss alternative options. 

If you'd like a new language to be added to Crowdin, for you to be able to provide translations for, please [open a new issue here](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/new?template=language_request.yml).

Please note, translations in BookStack are provided to the "Crowdin Global Translation Memory" which helps BookStack and other projects with finding translations. If you are not happy with contributing to this then providing translations to BookStack, even manually via GitHub, is not advised.

## üéÅ Contributing, Issues & Pull Requests

Feel free to [create issues](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/issues/new/choose) to request new features or to report bugs & problems. Just please follow the template given when creating the issue.

Pull requests are welcome but, unless it's a small tweak, it may be best to open the pull request early or create an issue for your intended change to discuss how it will fit into the project and plan out the merge. Just because a feature request exists, or is tagged, does not mean that feature would be accepted into the core project.

Pull requests should be created from the `development` branch since they will be merged back into `development` once done. Please do not build from or request a merge into the `release` branch as this is only for publishing releases. If you are looking to alter CSS or JavaScript content please edit the source files found in `resources/`. Any CSS or JS files within `public` are built from these source files and therefore should not be edited directly.

The project's code of conduct [can be found here](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack/blob/development/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## üîí Security

Security information for administering a BookStack instance can be found on the [documentation site here](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/security/).

If you'd like to be notified of new potential security concerns you can [sign-up to the BookStack security mailing list](https://updates.bookstackapp.com/signup/bookstack-security-updates).

## ‚ôø Accessibility

We want BookStack to remain accessible to as many people as possible. We aim for at least WCAG 2.1 Level A standards where possible although we do not strictly test this upon each release. If you come across any accessibility issues please feel free to open an issue.
